# SageMaker Custom model development Hands-on Lab

The goal of this notebook is to show how to develop custom Machine Learning model on SageMaker for your business usecase. 
This process will use the SageMaker built-in algorithm and Tensorflow image to query detect licene plate of a car and recognize the charcter of it by using CNN and computer vision technology. 

This HoL consists of four labs, each with the following details:

## Lab1. Data preparation
- Generate training images
- Image synthesis

## Lab2. Custom object detection with SageMaker built-in algorithm
- SageMaker built-in algorithm
- Custom Object Detection 
- Transfer Learning (Resnet-50 base

## Lab3. Custom CNN script with Tensorflow and Keras
- Custom Tensorflow script with Keras
- Custom CNN(Convolution Neural Net)

## Lab4. Training, Deploying and hosting custom model on SageMaker
- Tensorflow script mode
- Distributed training
- Endpoint hosting
